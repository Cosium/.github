Cosium develops cloud-based software solutions and devices
for the healthcare industry. In the few years since its inception
in 2003, Cosium has acquired a dominant position as an
influencer in software and hardware for customer-facing
applications, e.a. optical stores and audition centers, as well
as helping to manage from behind the scenes with our
Business Intelligence tools and innovative use of leading-edge
technologies.

Cosium is more than software: we offer a complete ICT
outsourcing service, able to support customers from large to
small, even distributed in different countries; we offer services
to the industry, from 3D representation and applications to
custom-designed electronics for optical retail and domiciliary
care.

Our international team based in Versailles is rapidly expanding
to be able to offer our powerful and innovative solutions to
more locales, for the benefit of healthcare professionals.

Cosium is also an important Open-Source software
contributor. The company authored code for many projects
including Chromium, Hibernate, Apache Maven, Jenkins,
Keycloak and Spring.
